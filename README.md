# EDUHUB DATABASE CREATION
In this project, I've leveraged MongoDB to design, implement, and optimize a NoSQL database solution for EduHub, an educational institution. 
This demonstrates my comprehensive understanding of MongoDB's concepts, operations, and best practices, and my ability to apply them to solve practical business requirements.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project implements the core MongoDB database backend for "EduHub," an online learning platform. It demonstrates comprehensive skills in:

- Database and collection creation
- Document insertion and data modeling
- Full CRUD operations
- The system supports key functionalities like student enrollment, instructor course management, lesson/assignment tracking, assignment submission/grading, and student progress monitoring.
